# basic-webpack-config

This project is meant to provide an easy-to-use initial template, which includes everything needed to begin developing a react application.

## Why not `create-react-app`?

Well [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and its `react-scripts` are nice if you do not need any other configuration and if you have no problem with unnecessary packages being installed.

I had several project where I started with `create-react-app` but later needed to eject to fassade.
The problem is, that the underlying configuration is pretty convoluted and not that easy to manually configure further.

So I created this MVP which has the simplest config possible to get started and still provide all needed libraries.

## Initially installed

This project uses [Yarn v3](https://yarnpkg.com/), [React v18](https://reactjs.org/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), [TypeScript v4.6.3](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Babel v7.16](https://babeljs.io/), [react-dom v18](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-client.html), [webpack v5.72](https://webpack.js.org/) and [react-router v6](https://reactrouterdotcom.fly.dev/docs/en/v6).

All those packages are configures and there are some simple pages and components provided to get started.
But the main idea is that everything is ready for you to start writing your application and fine tune the settings as needed.
